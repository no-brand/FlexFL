    "description": "\nI created simple project to demonstrate this:\nhttps://github.com/astafev/mockito-package-private-class/\nPlease take a look. Even if it can't be implemented, I think that mockito should throw some normal exception at time of creation.\nIn my variant on first creation it returns wrong-working mock (invokes real method instead of stubbed). On second creation throws exception that doesn't really connected with problem.\nEverything works fine if you mock package-private parent.\n"
