    "description": "\n\nThe fix for COMPRESS-117 which modified ArchiveStreamFactory().createArchiveInputStream(inputstream) results in short text files (empirically seems to be those <= 100 bytes) being detected as tar archives which obviously is not desirable if one wants to know whether or not the files are archives.\nI'm not an expert on compressed archives but perhaps the heuristic that if a stream is interpretable as a tar file without an exception being thrown should only be applied on archives greater than 100 bytes?\n\n"
