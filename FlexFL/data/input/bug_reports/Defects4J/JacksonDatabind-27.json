    "title": "Problem deserializing External Type Id if type id comes before POJO",
    "description": "\n(note: seems to be similar or related to FasterXML/jackson-module-afterburner#58)\nWith 2.6, looks like handling of External Type Id is broken in some rare (?) cases; existing unit tests did not catch this. At this point I am speculating this is due to some refactoring, or change to use more efficient 'nextFieldName()' method.\n"
