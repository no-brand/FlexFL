    "description": "\nHello,\nFirst off, thanks for a really useful library.\nSo, upgrading from 1.10.2 to 1.11.2 we see that boolean attributes are no longer collapsed when using html syntax. Example test case:\n    @Test\n    public void test() {\n        Document document = Jsoup.parse(\n                \"<html><head></head><body><hr size=\\\"1\\\" noshade=\\\"\\\"></body></html>\");\n        assertEquals(\"<html>\\n\" +\n                     \" <head></head>\\n\" +\n                     \" <body>\\n\" +\n                     \"  <hr size=\\\"1\\\" noshade>\\n\" +\n                     \" </body>\\n\" +\n                     \"</html>\",\n                     document.outerHtml());\n    }\n\nTracked it down to commit \"Refactored Attributes to be an array pair vs LinkedHashSet \" ea1fb65. The Attibutes.html(final Appendable accum, final Document.OutputSettings out) method no longer uses Attribute and fails to check the value of the attribute for an empty string(line 320).\nIf I may also suggest to use Attribute.shouldCollapseAttribute(String key, String val, Document.OutputSettings out) instead as a single source of truth as the boolean expression is complex enough and easy to make a mistake. Not sure if this would have an impact in performance though but I am guessing that optimizer will inline the call at some point anyways?\n"
