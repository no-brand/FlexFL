    "description": "\n\nThe TarArchiveInputStream.parsePaxHeaders method fails with a NegativeArraySizeException when there is an empty line at the end of the headers.\nThe inner loop starts reading the length, but it gets a newline (10) and ends up subtracting '0' (48) from it; the result is a negative length that blows up an attempt to allocate the rest array.\nI would say that a check to see if ch is less the '0' and break the loop if it is.\nI used npm pack aws-sdk@2.2.16 to generate a tarball with this issue.\n\n"
